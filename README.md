# Vending-Machine-

This Verilog project implements a vending machine using a finite state machine (FSM) with three states (s0, s1, s2). It processes user inputs representing coin insertions, determines the current state, dispenses an item (out), and calculates any change (change). The module operates synchronously with a clock and includes a reset functionality to return to the initial state. Ideal for learning FSM design and simulating vending machine logic.
